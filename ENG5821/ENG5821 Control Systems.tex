    \section{Stability}

    Mathematically, stability for linear, time-invariant systems can be determined from the location of the closed-loop poles:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{If the poles are only in the left half-plane, the system is stable.}
        \item{If any poles are in the right half-plane, the system is unstable.}
        \item{If the poles are on the j$\omega$ axis and in the left half plane, the system is marginally stable as long as the poles on the j$\omega$ axis are of unit multiplicity; it is unstable if there are any multiple j $\omega$ poles.}
    \end{itemize}
    

    \subsection{Routh Hurwitz}

    The \textit{Routh-Hurwitz criterion} lets us find how many poles are in each section of the s-plane without giving us the coordinates of the poles. Just knowing that there are poles in the right half-plane is enough to determine that a system is unstable. Under certain limited conditions, when an even polynomial is present, the Routh table can be used to factor the systemâ€™s characteristic equation.
