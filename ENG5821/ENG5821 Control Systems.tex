    \subsection{Sketching the Root Locus}

    \subsubsection{Number of Branches}

    The number of branches in a root locus equal the number of poles.

    \subsubsection{Symmetry}

    The root locus is symmetrical about the real axis.

    \subsubsection{Real Axis Segments}

    On the real axis, for $K > 0$ the root locus exists to the left of an odd number of real-axis, finite open-loop poles and/or finite open-loop zeros.

    \subsubsection{Starting and Ending Points}

    The root locus begins at the finite and infinite poles of $G(s)H(s)$ and ends at the finite and infinite zeros of $G(s)H(s)$.

    \subsubsection{Behavior at Infinity}

    The root locus approaches straight lines as asymptotes as the locus approaches infinity. Further, the equation of the asymptotes is given by the real-axis intercept, $\sigma_a$ and angle, $\theta_a$ as follows:
    \begin{center}
        $\sigma_a = \frac{\Sigma \text{ Finite Poles} - \Sigma \text{ Finite Zeros}}{\text{\# Finite Poles - \# Finite Zeros}}$ 
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        $\theta_a = \frac{(2k - 1)\pi}{\text{\# Finite Poles - \# Finite Zeros}}$ 
    \end{center}

    Where $k = \pm 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$ and the angle is given in radians with respect to the positive
extension of the real axis.

    \subsection{Refining the Sketch}

    \subsubsection{Breakaway/Break-in Point}

    At the breakaway or break-in point, the branches of the root locus form an angle of 180°/$n$ with the real axis, where $n$ is the number of closed-loop poles arriving at or departing from the single breakaway or break-in point on the real axis. These are the points when gain is at its minimum and maximum, respectively. \\
        
    For all points on the root locus, \\
    
    $K = -\frac{1}{G(s)H(s)}$, $\frac{1}{G(s)H(s)} = -1$ and by differential calculus, \\
    
    $K = -\frac{1}{G(\sigma)H(\sigma)}$ where breakpoints occur - setting $\sigma$ to 0 will produce $K$.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=300 px]{img/breakpoints} \\
    \end{center}

    Or, conversely, \\

    $\sum \frac{1}{\sigma + z_i} = \sum \frac{1}{\sigma + p_i}$ \\

    Where $z$ and $p$ are the zero and pole values. By equating the two sides and simplifying to a single equation, factoring can produce $\sigma$.

    \subsubsection{$j\omega$-Axis Crossings}

    The crossing of the $j\omega$ axis defines when the system becomes unstable. The crossing of the $\omega$ axis deines the frequency of oscillation, while the gain at the $j\omega$ axis yields the maximum positive gain for system stability. \\ 

    The $j\omega$ axis crossings can be found using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Forcing a row of zeros yields the gain, then going back a row and solving for the roots yields the frequency at the imaginary axis crossing.

    \subsubsection{Angles of Departure and Arrival}

    If we assume a point on the root locus $\epsilon$ close to a complex \textbf{pole}, the sum of angles drawn from all finite poles and zeros to this point is an odd multiple of 180$^\circ$. Except for the \textbf{pole} that is $\epsilon$ close to the point, we assume all angles drawn from all other poles and zeros are drawn directly to the \textbf{pole} that is near the point. Thus, the only unknown angle in the sum is the angle drawn from the \textbf{pole} that is $\epsilon$ close. We can solve for this unknown angle, which is also the angle of departure from this complex \textbf{pole}. \\

    $-\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 - \theta_4 - \theta_5 + \theta_6 =(2k+1)180^\circ$ \\ 
    
    \textit{or} \\ 

    $\theta_1 = \theta_2 + \theta_3 - \theta_4 - \theta_5 + \theta_6 -(2k+1)180^\circ$ \\

    $\theta_2 = \theta_1 - \theta_3 + \theta_4 + \theta_5 - \theta_6 -(2k+1)180^\circ$ \\

    \subsubsection{Plotting and Calibrating the Root Locus}

    When locating points on the root locus and finding their specified gain, for example as it crosses the radial line representing 20\% overshoot, such as the below graph where $\zeta = 0.45$ \\ 

    Evaluating the graph at points along the line, and summing the angles from poles and zeros, it can be determined if a point is on the root locus if the angles are a multiple of 180$^\circ$.
